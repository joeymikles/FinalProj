#this code starts with all the imports/libraries/settings being used
#then it dives into all the images being used for the game
#then it creates the actual screen, leading to the background being imported as the screen background with game overlapping
#next, is simply the borders/barriers of the game
#the food and snake is then made
#the food is given a small adjustement with turning it into a football
#next is all the important stuff with movements and describing the directions speed, and reactions the computer has to certain buttons being pressed and how it will display on the screen
#it then finished with how the "snake" reacts to the food and what happens if you die, ending with the final score
#game is then done
